# p5_demos
### Three extremely simle game demos.

The first is p5 using webgl which allows for 3D graphics. The second and third are examples in canvas. The difference is that the third builds on the second. Each one involves a camera element.

## WEBGL
  Move the box with arrow keys, 
  control the camera using keys pairs:
  
  q, a 
  
  w, s
  
  e, d
  
  r, f
  
  t, g
  
  y, h
  
  u, j
  
  i, k
  
  see the code for specific controls


## CANVAS

This example implements a camera on a 2D area. 
move the main character with the arrow keys. 
toggle the camera focus on the main character and the robot by clicking 'f'

## maze

All the features of the first canvas example but also shows how to implement a maze game board.
